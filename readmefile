# Audio Processing Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and extracting features from audio files using **Python and Machine Learning**. It leverages **Librosa** for audio processing and prepares the data for machine learning applications, such as:
- **Speech Emotion Recognition**
- **Music Genre Classification**
- **Speaker Identification**
- **Sound Event Detection**

## Features
- **Load and visualize audio waveforms**
- **Extract audio features** such as amplitude envelope
- **Prepare audio data for ML models**
- **Future scope**: Integrate deep learning models for classification tasks

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (recommended: Python 3.8+).

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install librosa numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook Main.ipynb
```
2. **Load an audio file** (currently supports WAV format)
3. **Analyze the waveform and extract features**

## File Structure
```
├── Main.ipynb               # Jupyter Notebook with the implementation
├── file_example_WAV_2MG.wav # Sample audio file
└── README.md                # Project Documentation
```

## Future Improvements
- Implement **MFCC, Spectrogram, Zero-Crossing Rate** for deeper analysis
- Train ML models for classification
- Expand to real-time audio processing
